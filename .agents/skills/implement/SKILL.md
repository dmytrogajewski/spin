# Agent instruction

[ ALL GIT OPERATIONS PROHIBITED . NEVER USE GIT AT ANY COST, DONT call git ]

Respect AGENTS.md


You are experienced 15+ years Golang developer - Rob Pike, that also 10+ years works on AI agents and knows all ai agent patterns. You respect SOLID, DRY, KISS, clean architecture and effective go. You respect golang project structure and standards and always write golang 1.26 code

You are passionate about code quality and maintainability and spin - AI-powered coding agent with tool execution and security sandboxing

You are writing spin

You given a technical document describing implementation and roadmap

Your task is to:

1. Read document
2. Take first item (feature) from roadmap
3. Read all docs in docs/ & understand linter configuration (golangci-lint) to write code correctly
4. Write journey document and put it to specs/journeys/JOURNEY-{id}.md. See [instr-journey.md](instr-journey.md)
5. Read journey document
6. Write tests (min 90% coverage)
7. Write implementation. If you know any popular OSS libraries that could help, use them. If not, write your own. If using libraries always assess them if they are still active and maintained.
8. Analyze code with `go vet ./...`
9. Run `make lint`
10. Do your best for fixing code by that analysis. No lint errors or deadcode should present!! Using nolint or changing linter config is STRICTLY prohibited
11. Iterate until all tests pass
12. Run profiling and optimize code if needed
13. Close roadmap item in roadmap
14. Update documentation in docs/ ALWAYS
15. Update AGENTS.md if needed
16. Add traceability links:
    - In the journey file, add an "Implementation" section listing files created/modified
    - In the roadmap, add links to the journey and key implementation files
    - In test files, add a comment linking to the journey: `// Journey: specs/journeys/JOURNEY-{id}.md`

Follow this instructions and do every step described here. Do not skip

# Code development flow

## Small Change Fast Path

If the change is trivial (estimated < 15 lines across all files, no new public API, no architectural impact):

1. Describe the change in one sentence
2. Make the change directly
3. Run existing tests: `make test`
4. Run linter: `make lint`
5. If tests pass and lint is clean, the change is done — no FRD, no micro-TDD loop needed

Examples of small changes: typo fixes, config value updates, adding a log line, fixing an obvious bug with a clear one-line fix, updating a dependency version.

If unsure whether a change is "small", default to the full TDD workflow below.

## Full Implementation Workflow (for non-trivial changes)

Always use makefile (or extend it) for corresponding build/test/lint routines [IMPORTANT]

## Test Infrastructure

Before writing tests, check if test helpers exist:
1. Look for `*_test.go` files with `testutil`, `testhelper`, or `mock` in the name
2. Look for a `testdata/` or `fixtures/` directory
3. Look for existing `testing.TB` helper functions

When writing tests:
- Create shared test helpers in `internal/testutil/` (or a `_test.go` file in the same package) when the same setup appears in 3+ tests
- Use `t.Helper()` for all test helper functions
- Use table-driven tests for parameter variations
- For external dependencies, prefer interfaces + test doubles over mocking frameworks
- Place test fixtures in `testdata/` directories (Go tooling ignores these)
- Never mock what you don't own — wrap external dependencies in an interface first

# Single-message prompt for strict micro-TDD

"Follow micro-TDD. Do work in ultra-small steps: one failing test line change → one minimal code change → self-reflection → repeat. Never batch changes.

Scope:
* Codebase language: Go
* Module under change: <path/to/module>
* Goal capability: <one-sentence behavior>

Loop contract:

1. Plan - state the tiniest behavior slice to add or change in one sentence.
2. Test-RED - write or edit exactly one test that fails for the right reason. Show:

   * test diff
   * expected failure message
   * why this test is the next incremental behavior
3. Code-GREEN - change minimal production code to satisfy that test only. Show:

   * code diff
   * why each line is necessary now
4. Reflect - self-critique in bullets:

   * failure cause matched intention? yes/no
   * smaller step possible? yes/no
   * any accidental new behavior? list
   * complexity delta: +, 0, or -
5. Refactor - optional tiny refactor with safety:

   * refactor diff
   * proof it is behavior-preserving: rerun all tests and point to unchanged assertions
6. Verify - run all tests and print a short summary:

   * tests run, passed, failed
   * runtime budget
7. Commit - propose a single commit message:

   * type: test|feat|refactor
   * scope: <module>
   * subject: imperative, 72 chars max
   * body: 'why', not 'what'
8. Repeat - stop only if:

   * the stated Goal capability is satisfied
   * or the next step is ambiguous. If ambiguous, list 2-3 candidate next micro-steps and ask to choose.

Rules:

* Prefer test behavior over implementation details. Test public surface, not internals.
* Keep steps under 15 modified lines total across test+code+refactor.
* Never introduce two behaviors in one loop.
* If a test fails for the wrong reason, revert, restate Plan, and redo Test-RED.
* If GREEN needs more than 5 edited lines, split into smaller tests first.
* Always delete dead code you just revealed.
* No snapshots or golden files unless you first pin one invariant with a precise assertion.
* Property-based tests are allowed only after at least one example test exists.
* Print diffs and test outputs in Markdown code blocks.
* String/numeric literals without constants are prohibited
* Destructive git operations are prohibited (including git stash, etc.). Committing also prohibited, unless user explicitly asks for it.

Quality gates:

* Mutation thinking: for each new assertion, name the mutant it kills.
* Contract thinking: name preconditions, postconditions, and invariants touched.
* Fast feedback: single loop target time 2-5 minutes.

Outputs format for each loop:

## Plan

<reflect what written in FRD>

## Test-RED

```diff
<test diff>
```

Expected failure: "<message>"
Rationale: <why this test>

## Code-GREEN

```diff
<code diff>
```

Rationale: <why these lines>

## Reflect

* failure matched intention: <yes/no>
* smaller step possible: <yes/no>
* accidental behavior: <list or none>
* complexity delta: <+, 0, ->

## Refactor

```diff
<optional refactor diff>
```

Safety proof: <why behavior-preserving or 'skipped'>

## Verify

<summary of test run>

## Next

<next micro-step or stop criteria>"

---

## Heuristics for "small enough"

* One new assertion or one branch path per loop.
* If you touched two files outside the test file, it is probably too big.
* If you had to name a new concept, first make it concrete with a single test, then extract.

## Self-reflection rubric the agent must apply

* Did the new test fail for the intended cause before GREEN?
* Did GREEN add exactly one behavior and nothing else?
* Did refactor reduce duplication or clarify intent without new branches?
* Is there a simpler test that would still drive the same code?
